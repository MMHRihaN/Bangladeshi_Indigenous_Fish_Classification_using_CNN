Description:
This app was a part of my undergraduate project. I named it 'FishBuddy'. I built my own dataset and combined it with an existing dataset of regional fishes of Bangladesh and trained the ML model on that dataset. I have used VGGNet. Some key features of this app are:
• A CNN and IoT-based system for recognizing 
indigenous Bangladeshi fish species.  
• Trained on a diverse dataset, deployed on 
mobile and web apps for easy identification.  
• Future plans include integration into a single 
IoT device using Raspberry Pi. 

Also, there are additional features such as
• An enhanced app with user verification, 
• An interactive blog section featuring multimedia 
content,
• A user-friendly interface with real
time location updates 
• Weather information, 
• A rating system.  

**Important Info**
N.B. After cloning this project on your pc/GitHub repo, please make sure you rename the root folder to 'bangladeshi_Indigenous_Fish_Classification_using_CNN' from 'Bangladeshi_Indigenous_Fish_Classification_using_CNN' otherwise it will create a problem for you when you try to run it on android studio because Android Studio prefers that the name of project will start with lowercase letter.

Instruction to run it:
• You must have Android Studio installed.
• Clone the repository and follow the step in 'Important Info'.
• Open it in Android Studio, compile and install it in your Android smartphone or an emulator, and enjoy.
